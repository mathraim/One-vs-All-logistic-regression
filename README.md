# One-vs-All-logistic-regression
One-vs-All logistic regression that implemented from scratch on matlab(octave)

In this exercise, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression to recognize hand-written digits

Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - 
from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.
This model trained on MNIST dataset will show you how the methods listed above can be used for this classification task.

- **ex3.m** - combines functions below to perform a One-vs-All-logistic-regression
- **ex3_nn.m** - combines functions below to perform a One-vs-All-logistic-regression
- **ex3data1.mat** - Training set of hand-written digits
